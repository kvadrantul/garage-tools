# Orchestrator MVP - Product Specification

## Overview

Orchestrator is a visual workflow automation platform with native support for AI agents (OpenClaw) and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) capabilities. It enables building deterministic business processes that can incorporate autonomous AI agent steps with human oversight.

## Vision

Create a hybrid automation platform that combines:
- **Deterministic workflows** for predictable, auditable processes
- **AI Agent integration** (OpenClaw) for intelligent, adaptive steps
- **Human-in-the-Loop** for critical decision points and oversight

## Target Users

- Developers building business automation
- Teams needing AI-augmented workflows
- Single-user local deployment (MVP)

## Core Features

### 1. Visual Canvas Editor
- Drag-and-drop node placement
- Visual connection between nodes
- Real-time execution visualization
- Zoom, pan, selection

### 2. Workflow Execution
- In-process execution (no external queue)
- Sequential and parallel node execution
- Error handling and retry logic
- Execution history and logs

### 3. Base Nodes
- **Triggers**: Webhook, Schedule (Cron), Manual
- **Logic**: If/Switch, Merge, Split
- **Actions**: HTTP Request, Code/Function
- **Special**: Agent (OpenClaw), HITL Approval

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop
- Pause workflow for human decision
- Approval/Rejection UI
- Custom input forms
- Timeout handling

### 5. Agent Integration
- OpenClaw agent invocation
- Pass context to agent
- Receive agent response
- Stream agent "thinking" to UI (optional)

## Non-Goals (MVP)

- Multi-user / Teams
- Role-based access control
- PostgreSQL / Redis
- Workflow versioning
- 300+ integrations (add later)
- Enterprise features
- Horizontal scaling

## Success Metrics

1. Can create workflow visually on canvas
2. Can execute workflow and see real-time status
3. Can use Agent node to call OpenClaw
4. Can pause for human approval (HITL)
5. Data persists in SQLite

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, React Flow, TailwindCSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Express/Fastify, TypeScript |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3 or Drizzle) |
| Real-time | WebSocket (ws) |
| Agent | OpenClaw CLI |

## Risks

1. **Canvas complexity** - React Flow learning curve
2. **Executor edge cases** - Parallel execution, error handling
3. **OpenClaw integration** - CLI spawning, timeout handling
