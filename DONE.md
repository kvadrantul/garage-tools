## Completed Components

### 1. Shared Package (`packages/shared/`)

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `src/types.ts` | ~280 lines. All TypeScript interfaces: WorkflowDefinition, WorkflowNode, NodeType (11 types), ExecutionStatus, NodeContext, NodeResult, HITLRequest/Response, API types, WebSocket message types, NodeDefinition for UI |
| `src/schema.ts` | Drizzle ORM schema with 6 tables + relations |
| `src/index.ts` | Re-exports types |

### 2. Database (`packages/backend/src/db/`)

6 SQLite tables with indexes:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `workflows` | Workflow definitions (id, name, description, definition JSON, settings, active flag) |
| `executions` | Execution records (status, triggerType, triggerData, error, timestamps) |
| `execution_nodes` | Per-node execution data (status, inputData, outputData, error) |
| `credentials` | Stored credentials (name, type, encrypted data) |
| `webhooks` | Registered webhook paths (workflowId, nodeId, path, method) |
| `hitl_requests` | HITL pause records (type, requestData, status, responseData, expiresAt) |

Database initializes automatically on server start via `initializeDatabase()`.

### 3. API Routes (`packages/backend/src/api/`)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/workflows` | GET | List workflows (pagination) |
| `/api/workflows/:id` | GET | Get workflow by ID |
| `/api/workflows` | POST | Create workflow |
| `/api/workflows/:id` | PUT | Update workflow |
| `/api/workflows/:id` | DELETE | Delete workflow |
| `/api/workflows/:id/execute` | POST | Execute workflow (wired to ExecutionService) |
| `/api/workflows/:id/activate` | POST | Activate workflow |
| `/api/workflows/:id/deactivate` | POST | Deactivate workflow |
| `/api/executions` | GET | List executions (with workflow name join) |
| `/api/executions/:id` | GET | Get execution + all node results |
| `/api/executions/:id/stop` | POST | Stop running execution (via ExecutionService) |
| `/api/executions/:id` | DELETE | Delete execution |
| `/api/hitl` | GET | List HITL requests (filter by status/executionId) |
| `/api/hitl/:id/respond` | POST | Respond to HITL (approve/reject/submit) |
| `/api/credentials` | GET | List credentials (without sensitive data) |
| `/api/credentials/:id` | GET | Get credential by ID (without sensitive data) |
| `/api/credentials` | POST | Create credential (data stored as JSON buffer) |
| `/api/credentials/:id` | PUT | Update credential |
| `/api/credentials/:id` | DELETE | Delete credential |
| `/webhooks/:path` | ALL | Webhook handler - triggers workflow execution |

### 3b. Webhook Handler (`packages/backend/src/webhooks/`)

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `webhook-handler.ts` | Routes incoming HTTP requests to trigger workflow executions |

- `ALL /webhooks/:path` - looks up webhook by path, validates method, executes workflow
- `registerWebhooksForWorkflow()` - called on workflow activate
- `unregisterWebhooksForWorkflow()` - called on workflow deactivate

### 4. Execution Engine (`packages/backend/src/executor/`)

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `graph-resolver.ts` | Builds adjacency lists from workflow definition. Provides: `getStartNodes()`, `getExecutionOrder()` (topological sort), `getNodeInputs()`, `getDownstreamNodes()`, `getEdge()` |
| `state-manager.ts` | In-memory state during execution: node results, output indices (for conditional routing), executed-set tracking |
| `execution-runner.ts` | Main orchestrator. Creates execution record, walks graph from triggers, executes nodes via registry, handles conditional branching (outputIndex), HITL pauses (polls DB for response), broadcasts events via EventEmitter. Supports abort via AbortController |
| `errors.ts` | Error classes: ExecutionError, NodeExecutionError, HITLTimeoutError, AbortedError |

**Data flow**: trigger data -> each node receives output of predecessors -> conditional nodes set `outputIndex` -> downstream routing checks `sourceHandle` match -> merge nodes collect multiple inputs.

**HITL flow**: node returns `waitForHitl` -> runner inserts `hitl_requests` row, sets execution to `waiting_hitl` -> polls every 1s for response -> on approve, resumes downstream execution.

### 5. Node Runners (`packages/backend/src/nodes/`)

All 11 node types implemented with `NodeRunner` interface (`execute(context) -> NodeResult`):

| Node | File | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `manual-trigger` | `triggers/manual.ts` | Passes triggerData + timestamp |
| `webhook-trigger` | `triggers/webhook.ts` | Extracts headers/query/body/method/path |
| `schedule-trigger` | `triggers/schedule.ts` | Passes scheduled timestamp |
| `http-request` | `actions/http-request.ts` | fetch() with method/headers/body/timeout, credential injection (bearer, api_key, basic_auth) |
| `code` | `actions/code.ts` | Sandboxed via `node:vm` with $input/$inputs/$node/$execution/$result. 10s timeout. Console.log capture. Proper async/await support |
| `set` | `actions/set.ts` | Modes: set, append, remove. Option `keepOnlySet` |
| `if` | `logic/if.ts` | Conditions: equals/notEquals/contains/gt/lt/gte/lte/isEmpty/isNotEmpty. Combine: AND/OR. Returns `outputIndex` 0 (true) or 1 (false) |
| `switch` | `logic/switch.ts` | Multi-case matching on nested value path, optional fallback output |
| `merge` | `logic/merge.ts` | Modes: append (array concat) or combine (object merge) |
| `agent` | `ai/agent.ts` | OpenAI API + OpenClaw CLI modes. Streaming support. Config: provider/model/systemPrompt/temperature/timeout |
| `hitl` | `ai/hitl.ts` | Returns `waitForHitl` with type/message/details/fields/options/timeout |

Registry: `nodes/registry.ts` maps type string -> runner instance.

### 6. ExecutionService (`packages/backend/src/services/`)

Singleton pattern via `initExecutionService(broadcast)` / `getExecutionService()`.

- Manages `Map<executionId, ExecutionRunner>` for active executions
- Forwards all runner events to WebSocket broadcast
- `executeWorkflow()` -- creates runner, subscribes events, returns executionId
- `stopExecution()` -- aborts runner + updates DB

### 6b. Scheduler (`packages/backend/src/services/scheduler.ts`)

Singleton pattern via `initScheduler()` / `getScheduler()`.

- Manages `Map<jobKey, CronJob>` for scheduled workflows
- `initialize()` -- loads all active workflows, creates CronJobs for schedule-trigger nodes
- `registerWorkflowSchedules()` -- called on workflow activate
- `unregisterWorkflow()` -- called on workflow deactivate
- Triggers `executionService.executeWorkflow(workflowId, 'schedule', triggerData)`

### 7. WebSocket Server (`packages/backend/src/index.ts`)

- Path: `ws://localhost:3000/ws`
- Client messages: `subscribe:execution`, `unsubscribe:execution`
- Server broadcasts: `execution:started/completed/failed`, `execution:node:started/completed/error`, `hitl:required/resolved`
- Subscriptions tracked per executionId. Also broadcasts to all connected clients.

### 8. Frontend (`packages/frontend/`)

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `App.tsx` | Routes: `/workflows`, `/workflows/new`, `/workflows/:id`, `/executions`, `/executions/:id`, `/hitl` |
| `api/client.ts` | API client for workflows, executions, HITL, credentials endpoints |
| `stores/workflowStore.ts` | Zustand store: nodes, edges, selectedNode, isDirty, CRUD operations |
| `pages/WorkflowList.tsx` | Dashboard with workflow cards, create/delete/execute actions, nav header |
| `pages/WorkflowEditor.tsx` | React Flow canvas + HITL popup panel when waiting for approval |
| `pages/ExecutionList.tsx` | Table of executions with status, duration, stop/delete actions |
| `pages/ExecutionDetail.tsx` | Execution summary + per-node results with JSON viewers |
| `pages/HITLList.tsx` | Standalone page listing all HITL requests with inline response forms |
| `components/canvas/NodePalette.tsx` | Sidebar with 11 draggable node types grouped by category |
| `components/panels/NodeConfigPanel.tsx` | Dynamic config forms per node type |
| `components/panels/HITLPanel.tsx` | Popup panel for approval/input/selection responses |
| `components/nodes/WorkflowNode.tsx` | Custom node: color-coded, status rings (waiting_hitl=amber pulse) |
| `hooks/useWebSocket.ts` | WebSocket hook with subscribe/unsubscribe, handles hitl:required events |

### 9. E2E Verification

Tested via API: `manual-trigger -> set -> if` workflow.
- All 3 nodes executed successfully
- Data correctly flows through pipeline (set merges values, if evaluates condition)
- Execution record + per-node records stored in DB with input/output data
